## Domain
   Cyber attacks are a common problem that threatens modern-day security.
   The current project focuses on solving this problem by implementing artificial intelligence that utilizes forward and backward chaining to predict potential and ongoing    attacks.
## Methodologies
   - Backward Chaining
   - Forward Chaining
