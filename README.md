## Domain
   Cyber attacks are a common problem that threatens modern-day security.
   The current project focuses on solving this problem by implementing artificial intelligence that utilizes forward and backward chaining to predict potential and ongoing    attacks.
## Methodologies
   *	Backward chaining is implemented so that if a conclusion is given, the conditions that caused it are backtracked, and if successful, could lead to further clauses being      realized as causes of the given conclusion.
   * Forward chaining works in a way that if a condition is given, then the results and consequences of it are found and if success, could lead to other clauses being realized      as consequences of this condition.

## Decision tree (Sample)

## Knowledge Base
  * Rules
  * Clauses
  * Variable List
  * Conclusion List

## Source code
  * forward_chaining.cpp
  * backward_chaining.cpp
  * mainapp.cpp
   
## Analysis of the program
  * Theoretically, the program should predict attacks and prevent them by presenting the user with a suggestion or solution. But for the most part, almost every conclusion for     an attack given by the user leads to preventable solutions.
